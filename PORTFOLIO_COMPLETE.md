## 💼 YOUR INTERVIEW NARRATIVE

### Before (With 1 Model):
> "I built an ML model that finds revenue leakage..."

**Interviewer thinks**: Interesting, but is it a one-off?

### After (With 2 Models):
> "I've built two production ML models for SaaS businesses. One finds lost revenue ($372K identified), the other prevents customer churn (85% accuracy). Both are deployed with live dashboards. This demonstrates I can systematically apply AI to different financial problems."

**Interviewer thinks**: This person can actually build and deploy ML solutions repeatedly!

## 🎤 ELEVATOR PITCHES

### 30-Second Version:
> "I've built two production ML models for SaaS finance operations. The first identifies $370K in lost revenue with 88% accuracy. The second predicts customer churn with 85% accuracy, enabling proactive retention. Both are deployed with live dashboards you can test. This demonstrates I can systematically apply AI to solve different financial problems."

### 2-Minute Version:
> "As a CFO transitioning into Web3 and AI, I wanted to prove I could build, not just talk about, AI-powered finance operations. So I built two production ML models.
>
> The first is a revenue leakage detector. SaaS companies lose 5-10% of revenue to billing errors, failed payments, and contract mistakes. My model analyzes account data and identifies leakage with 88% accuracy. On test data, it found $372K in annual leakage across 1,000 accounts.
>
> The second is a customer churn predictor. Acquiring a SaaS customer costs thousands of dollars, but churn happens silently. My model predicts which customers will churn 30-90 days in advance with 85% accuracy, enabling proactive retention. At a $50M company, this could save $1-3M annually.
>
> Both models are deployed with interactive Streamlit dashboards. You can test them yourself right now. What differentiates me from other CFO candidates is I don't just understand AI conceptually - I can build and deploy working systems."
