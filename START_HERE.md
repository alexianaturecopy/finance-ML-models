## 💼 INTERVIEW PREPARATION

### Must-Know Statistics
- **Model Accuracy**: 88%
- **Test Data Size**: 1,000 accounts
- **Leakage Identified**: $372,744 annually
- **Average per Account**: $1,281/year

### Elevator Pitch (30 sec)
"I built a machine learning model that detects revenue leakage in SaaS businesses. On 1,000 test accounts, it identified $370K in annual leakage with 88% accuracy. It's a production-ready dashboard on my GitHub that provides specific recommendations for recovering lost revenue."

### Key Differentiator
"Most CFO candidates talk about their experience analyzing data. I can show you working code that solves real financial problems. This proves I can bridge traditional finance and modern AI—exactly what Web3 and AI companies need."

## 📊 MODEL QUICK FACTS

**What It Does**:
- Predicts which SaaS accounts have billing issues
- Estimates dollar amount of revenue leakage
- Provides risk scores (High/Medium/Low)
- Recommends specific recovery actions

**How It Works**:
- Stage 1: Random Forest classifier (has leakage yes/no)
- Stage 2: Gradient Boosting regressor (leakage amount)
- 14 features from payment, engagement, and usage data

**Business Impact**:
- Identifies 5-10% of revenue at risk
- Finance teams recover 60-80% of flagged leakage
- ROI payback within 6 months
- Scales to thousands of accounts
