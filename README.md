## 💼 Business Value

### SaaS Models (#1 & #2)

**Revenue Leakage Detection**
- Problem: Companies lose 5-10% revenue to billing errors
- Solution: ML identifies leakage automatically
- Impact: $372K identified in 1,000 accounts

**Customer Churn Prediction**
- Problem: 5-7% annual churn costs millions
- Solution: Predicts churn 30-90 days early
- Impact: $1-3M saved through retention

### Healthcare Models (#3 & #4)

**Patient Payment Propensity**
- Problem: 20-30% collection rates on patient AR
- Solution: Predicts payment likelihood
- Impact: 30-40% improvement = $900K

**Claims Denial Prediction**
- Problem: 10-15% denial rate impacts cash flow
- Solution: Pre-submission risk assessment
- Impact: 50% denial reduction = $3M recovered
